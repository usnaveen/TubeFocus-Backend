The next feature that I want to add is during an entire session the user will be watching various videos and different scores will be produced for each of those videos and then when the session ends there will be a summary created in which we will show them the average score but along with that I want to now give out a message that is really custom to their use case for example let's say the user set the goal as learning linear algebra and he watched ten videos and about eight of them were something related to linear algebra and two of them were about Rubik's Cube solving so we can add a cheeky message saying that good job with that linear algebra session but you sneaked in a little bit of cubing as well or something funny and witty based on their custom session history so to achieve that what I'm trying to do is I will have some small language model along with these other sentence transformer models that we have and my goal is one second  lightweight LLM model that can look at the session history and understand how it went and based on that produce a one-line witty comment about the current session. It should be in a positive tone encouraging the user and if suppose the user have failed their goal to a larger extent then it can motivate them to come back and work harder while also giving a little bit tease of how they used the session up. So first of all find what model would be the best for this purpose and then download that model into our models file folder and then the stored session history will be stored locally by the Chrome extension so I want you to write some detailed prompts to instruct the other model that is running on the extension folder to locally store all the video titles and description locally and that has to be deleted once the session has ended but before deleting that that entire stuff has to be sent to the cloud and in the cloud we will run this natural language model and return a comment based on it along with the score and everything



Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how to select a lightweight LLM for generating witty, goal-aware summaries, download it into your cloud backend, and set up the Chrome extension logic for tracking and uploading session history.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Best Lightweight Model for Witty Summaries**

You're looking for:

* Fast inference on low-resources (1-2 vCPUs, <4GB RAM)
* Capable of basic humor, tone, and summarization
* Can accept structured input (like a session log)
* Open-source and downloadable

### üî• Recommended Model: **`mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1` (Quantized)**

* Hugging Face: [mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1)
* Use quantized version like `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF` to run on CPU
* Works well with structured prompts and generates creative, safe, and concise output

üí° **Alternative lightweight options (if Mistral is too heavy):**

* `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`
* `google/flan-t5-small` (less witty but fast)
* `NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral` (more capable, still 7B)

---

## üì¶ 2. **How to Download Mistral Instruct (GGUF CPU Model)**

Here‚Äôs the terminal script (run on your cloud backend with Python + `llama.cpp` or `text-generation-webui`):

```bash
# Step 1: Make folder
mkdir -p models/mistral-7b

# Step 2: Use huggingface-cli to login (optional if private model)
# huggingface-cli login

# Step 3: Download GGUF version
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf -O models/mistral-7b/model.gguf
```

If you're using `llama.cpp`:

```bash
./main -m models/mistral-7b/model.gguf -p "Your prompt goes here"
```

---

## üìÅ 3. **Chrome Extension: Local Session Tracker**

### üîí Local Storage of Video Titles and Descriptions

Add this to your `background.js` or `service_worker.js`:

```javascript
let sessionVideos = [];

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'videoData') {
    sessionVideos.push({
      title: message.title,
      description: message.description,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }

  if (message.type === 'endSession') {
    // Upload session to cloud
    fetch('https://your-cloud-endpoint.com/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        goal: message.goal,
        session: sessionVideos
      })
    }).then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Show summary and witty message
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'summary', data });
        sessionVideos = []; // Clear local data
      });

    sendResponse({ status: 'Session uploaded and cleared' });
  }
});
```

In your content script:

```javascript
// Called when user starts watching a new video
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: 'videoData',
  title: 'Intro to Eigenvalues',
  description: 'A quick dive into eigenvalues in linear algebra'
});
```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 4. **Cloud Function / Flask API for Generating Summary**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from mistral_runner import generate_summary  # custom function using llama.cpp

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/upload", methods=["POST"])
def handle_upload():
    data = request.json
    goal = data["goal"]
    session = data["session"]

    # Run LLM to generate summary
    witty_summary = generate_summary(goal, session)

    # Compute average score (assume backend scoring exists)
    avg_score = compute_average_score(goal, session)

    return jsonify({
        "summary": witty_summary,
        "average_score": avg_score
    })
```

---

## üß† 5. **Prompt Format for Witty Summary**

```python
def build_prompt(goal, session):
    prompt = f"""You're a witty session coach.

A user set their learning goal to "{goal}". During this session, they watched the following videos:\n"""

    for i, video in enumerate(session):
        prompt += f"{i+1}. {video['title']} - {video['description']}\n"

    prompt += """
Please write a short, funny, and encouraging one-line comment summarizing how the session went. 
If most videos match the goal, praise their dedication. If they drifted, tease them gently and motivate them to refocus next time.
Tone: Friendly, positive, witty.
Output: Just the one-liner."""

    return prompt
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Output

> **Input (goal: "linear algebra")**
>
> Videos watched:
>
> * "Matrix Multiplication Explained"
> * "Eigenvalues"
> * "Solving Rubik‚Äôs Cube in 10 secs"

> **Output:**
> *‚ÄúLinear algebra champion in the making ‚Äî though I caught you taking a cube break. Respect.‚Äù*

Would you like me to help you implement the `generate_summary()` function for `llama.cpp` or generate a test case using real data?


But before that, first of all, I want to understand what is the best strategy to do all this. Because initially what I do is, I... ...containered all the models and the relevant code and uploaded it in Google Cloud under Cloud Run. And I was running this container over there. But I think this may not be the best option. Because there are options like Vertex AI, where I can directly access these models. So, I am just re-evaluating my entire strategy now. So, my initial Docker container, it has this setup where it pulls video information like title and description based on the YouTube URL using YouTube API. And then it uses sentence transformers to compare this title and description with user-defined goal and then return a score out of 100. And it has two endpoints over there. One predicts the score based on just the title and another one predicts it based on title and description. So, this is the setup of the Docker container there. So, now you tell me if there is a better way to host it on cloud, maybe using Vertex AI or any other option.



You're right to re-evaluate the architecture now that your project is evolving beyond just REST endpoints. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of **your current setup**, what you‚Äôre trying to do next, and the **best strategy** based on cost, flexibility, and performance:

---

## ‚úÖ Your Current Setup (Cloud Run Docker)

* **Containerized app** hosted on Google Cloud Run.
* Two endpoints:

  * `/predict` using only title
  * `/predict` using title + description
* Uses:

  * YouTube API to fetch metadata
  * Sentence Transformers (e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* Output: Score from 0‚Äì100 measuring goal alignment

üí° This is lightweight and fast ‚Äî great for stateless inference ‚Äî and Cloud Run is a good fit when:

* Your model is small (e.g. < 1GB RAM)
* You don‚Äôt need a GPU
* You want scalable REST APIs

---

## üîÑ What You‚Äôre Planning Now

* Add session-level logic (multiple videos over time)
* Generate witty summaries using an LLM
* Process structured session history
* Possibly use more compute-heavy models like Mistral or TinyLlama

---

## üöÄ Recommendation: Hybrid Architecture

| Component                      | Best Strategy                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Metadata + scoring (fast)**  | ‚úÖ Stay on **Cloud Run** ‚Äî lightweight, scalable, low-cost                                  |
| **LLM (witty summaries)**      | ‚úÖ Use **Vertex AI (Generative AI Models)** or **run quantized models on a GCE VM**         |
| **Session storage + triggers** | ‚úÖ Use **Cloud Functions** or **Pub/Sub** to trigger summary generation on session end      |
| **Backend coordination**       | Use a **Firebase Function** or Cloud Function as the central handler (extension ‚Üí backend) |

---

## üß† Detailed Options for the LLM Component

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Vertex AI Generative Models (Best if using Google's LLMs)**

* You can use PaLM 2, Gemini 1.5 etc.
* Example prompt input: JSON-formatted session history
* Automatically scales
* Easy to secure, no infra maintenance

```python
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel
model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison")
response = model.predict(prompt)
```

üî∏ **Good for:** quick prototyping, production-scale summaries
üî∏ **Downside:** can't run your own custom models like Mistral

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: GCE VM with Mistral (Best if using OSS LLMs like Mistral, TinyLlama)**

* Launch a **GCE VM** with 1 GPU (or just CPU with quantized models)
* Use `llama.cpp`, `vllm`, or `text-generation-webui`
* Expose a Flask server (or FastAPI) to accept structured session input and return summary

```bash
gcloud compute instances create mistral-server \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
  --boot-disk-size=30GB \
  --image-family=ubuntu-2204-lts \
  --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud
```

üî∏ **Good for:** full control, privacy, model experimentation
üî∏ **Downside:** needs manual autoscaling + some ops effort

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 3: Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**

* Upload your fine-tuned or chosen model to Hugging Face
* Pay-per-use
* Easy to consume with an HTTP request

üî∏ **Good for:** minimal ops, quick scale
üî∏ **Downside:** potentially expensive for high-volume use

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What You Should Do Now (Recommended Plan)

### üîß Split your services into two layers:

| Task                          | Where to run                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Video scoring (current model) | ‚úÖ Cloud Run (keep using container)               |
| Session storage               | ‚úÖ Chrome extension + Firebase or Firestore       |
| Witty summary generation      | ‚úÖ Vertex AI (text-bison) or GCE VM with Mistral  |
| Session-end coordination      | ‚úÖ Cloud Function (triggered on extension upload) |

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Summary Table of Options

| Task                         | Best Tool          | Reason                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| API-based scoring            | Cloud Run          | Fast, simple, cheap       |
| Witty LLM comment generation | Vertex AI (or GCE) | Can handle long prompts   |
| Session upload + trigger     | Cloud Functions    | Event-driven, low-cost    |
| Local tracking in extension  | LocalStorage / JS  | Isolated per user, secure |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

**Stay with Cloud Run for current title-based scoring.**
Use **Vertex AI** if you're okay with Google's LLMs, otherwise go with **GCE VM + quantized Mistral** for LLM-powered witty summaries.
Trigger this LLM via a **Cloud Function** when session ends.
